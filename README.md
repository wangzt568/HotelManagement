# HotelManagement
A hotel management system (HMS) is software that facilitates a hotelâ€™s reservation management and administrative tasks. The most important functions include front-desk operations, reservations, channel management, housekeeping, rate and occupancy management, and payment processing. Although PMS software mostly controls reservation and financial transactions, it may allow you to manage housekeeping and perform human resources management as well. In general, PMS facilitates the main processes in a hotel related to internal and external operations.

Hotel Hotel Management System (PMS): Functions, Modules & Integrations

This Project is based on microservices structure.Which is seperated in different services.

1.
We built booking-client as a central reservation module.Which can connect to an front-end web ui based on Angular 8.It contains the detail of the room in a hotel for customers to choose.

public class RoomDetail {

  private final String id;
  private final String name;
  private final Type type;

  public static enum Type {
    SINGLE, DOUBLE, QUEEN, SUITE, STUDIO
  }

}

And I used feign as a tool to implement microservice structure and build RESTful API.I used REST template.And here is the configureation.
public class RestTemplateConfig {

  @Bean
  @LoadBalanced
  public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
  }
  
2.Boot-admin

We also build a admin server for the start up to management of all the data.
Used @EnableAdminServer annotations
